## About The Project

This project was originally written to automate a task I performed at work where we would need to inform our business partners and clients of our offices closure during holidays a week in advance.

We would need to send each client/business partner a uniform email notification template manually. Given it would take hours to finish sending to the entire list of email contacts we had; I wrote this script to automate this process minimal human intervention.

It was originally written to only be run through the command prompt but I rewrote it to be more user friendly for my coworkers who did not know how to program.

Eventually I realized it could be very useful tool for those who work in jobs that regularly send uniform emails to different email contacts and that is why I published this to github w/ instructions on how to use it.
